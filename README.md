# Fast Integer Reversal in JavaScript
A challenge on leetcode.com (https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-integer/) which takes a signed 32-bit integer x and returns x with its digits reversed.

This was my attempt at it, it had a couple of iterations for enhancing performance and speed. It also includes unit tests to ensure it would get accepted, along with a runtime test.

The runtime of this solution in best case was anywhere between 51-68ms (99.89% at the time, 98.42% as of writing this), while the memory usage was 40.4MB (100% at the time, 100% as of writing this).

Here is an image of the final accepted code at the time:

* Part of this task included a personal challenge to myself of trying to make less readable, but more functional code, I do not normally code like this.

** Please attempt the challenge yourself before you use the solution.
